## Introduction:
A JAVA based Android Application aimed to make our countrymen smarter, safer, more aware and a more connected altogether. It's a community-app deployed on a city-level that connects people with minimum skillset searching for a job, to people who need help for such jobs. Apart from providing paid job options to people by people, the app also encourages participation in community-building activities(plantation drives, event organisation, to name a few). This platform also helps in making the community a safer place by raising an alarm for help to all the users within 1km radius, in case of emergency situation reported by a user.
